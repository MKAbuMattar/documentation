\chapter*{Abstract}

An abstract can be either descriptive or informative. A descriptive abstract summarizes the motivation, scope and methods used to attain the solution or findings. An informative on the other hand, is almost like the table of contents written in paragraph. It also includes the results, conclusions and recommendations. The abstract should not exceed 300 words and its contents are italicized\cite{knuth:1984}.
